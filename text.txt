****
create an applciation
****
1 . python manage.py startapp <app_name>
2. Add PagesConfig from pages/apps in the listing settings apps area,
    this enable the pages application to be recognized
3. Create a urls.py in the pages app
4. add -> to the listing / settings, in the 'DIRS' : []
    'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')], # tell the application where to find the template

5. Add base_layout.html  to the template folder, this will be used to avoid repetition in certain areas of the pages (html)
it can also be extended

{% block content %} {% endblock%}
is used as areas that can be dynamic


6.  create a static folder in the application
    copy the contents of the asset to the static folder
##
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static') # when deployed, the collectstatic command
    # is used collects all static folders in all apps
    # it takes them and puts them into the root static folder
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
# set the location of the static folder which has been created
STATICFILES_DIR = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'listings/static')
]

# python manage.py help -> yoy can see that there is a command "collectstatic"
this is used to collect every static folder in every app and create one into what ever has been defined as the
STATIC_ROOT

# Add the static folder in the .gitignore file
# Add the static folder in 'listing/static'
# python manage.py collectstatic # to create the static folder in the root

8. copy the content of the html resources and replace the layout in the templates folder
Ensure to add the {% load static %} at the top of the html file
this allows the html file to have access to the static data
this references what ever the static folder is, that is defined in the settings (listing/settings)


9. change the links to correspond to the resources via the static
    eg
        href="{%static 'css/bootstrap.css' %}">
        <script src="{% static 'js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js' %}"></script>

10. update the base_layout.html with the theme file
    by adding sections of the theme html that will be used in multiple files
    sections like footer, navigation etc

12. simple mistake using the template
    {$ %}
    using dollar $ sign instead of percentage % sign

13.
    # index here is for the index page which is routed in the urlpatterns in settings.py
    update the link on the breadcrumb to be href="{% url 'index' '%}"
